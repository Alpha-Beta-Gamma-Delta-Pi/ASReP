Aim: create train, val, test with normal and reversed files.


-> import json.gz file

-> read asin, reviewerID, unixReviewTime, countUser {dict}, countProduct{dict}
-> write usermap {user id to rev id}, itemmap {prod id to }

-> train.txt has u_id {0-n}, i_id {0-n}, t {unixReviewTime},,,  order it acc to unixReviewTime
-> train_reveresed is train file in reverse order of time
